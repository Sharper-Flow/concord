"""Tests for check-migration-compatibility.py.

The validator decides whether a migration may be declared additive, and an
additive declaration is what lets an older binary open a newer database. A
wrong "additive" verdict is silent corruption, so the classifier's boundary
cases are pinned here rather than left to the live schema, which happens to
exercise only some of them.
